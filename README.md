## üåç Usage

### Config Setup:

- **Keep and store your RSS sources and categories in the "_config/make_json.py_‚Äù file. Instead of deleting sources that you need to filter, comment them out using ‚Äú#‚Äù. This way, you won't lose the source, and you can apply the filter as needed. Running the file will generate your "_config.json_" file.**

- **To view the past news and perform analysis, you can use the ‚Äúdb‚Äù file.**

**Once ‚Äúdupnews.py‚Äù is running, the news will be added to the database.**

**To inspect the database, install a database management software.**

**For example, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install the SQLite extension from the extensions section.**
